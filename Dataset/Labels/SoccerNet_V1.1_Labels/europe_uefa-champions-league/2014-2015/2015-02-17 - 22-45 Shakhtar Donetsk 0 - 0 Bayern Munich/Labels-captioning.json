            "description": "Let's hope the managers of both teams will be able to spark the players into life in the next matches. Up to this point the game today has lacked any interesting or exciting moments. The away team was superior on the pitch today. It's obvious that defence had the highest priority for the home side. The away team made a lot of passes and attempted to maintain possession."
